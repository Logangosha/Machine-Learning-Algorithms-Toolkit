# ðŸ¤– Neural Networks with scikit-learn: Regression & Classification

This project demonstrates using scikit-learn's neural networks (MLP) for **both** regression and classification tasks.

---

## ðŸ§  What is an MLP?

- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is a neural network model that can perform:
  - **Classification:** Assign inputs to discrete categories
  - **Regression:** Predict continuous values

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

The `NeuralNetworkModel` class supports two tasks, controlled by the `task` parameter:

- `task='classification'` for classification problems  
- `task='regression'` for regression problems

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example: Regression

```python
from neural_networks import NeuralNetworkModel

# Create and train regression model
reg_model = NeuralNetworkModel(task='regression', hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), max_iter=300)
reg_model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Predict continuous outputs
y_pred = reg_model.predict(X_test)
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example: Classification

```python
from neural_networks import NeuralNetworkModel

# Create and train classification model
clf_model = NeuralNetworkModel(task='classification', hidden_layer_sizes=(50,), max_iter=300)
clf_model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Predict class labels
y_pred = clf_model.predict(X_test)
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

- **Regression:**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - RÂ² Score
- **Classification:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score (via classification report)

---

## ðŸ“š Dependencies

- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Productivity Tip

Switch tasks easily by toggling the `task` parameter â€” no need to change your pipeline drastically!

---

## ðŸ¤“ Fun Fact

MLPs are "universal approximators" â€” with enough neurons and layers, they can model virtually any function! ðŸ”¥
