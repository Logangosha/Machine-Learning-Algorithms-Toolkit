# ðŸŒ¸ Naive Bayes

This module implements a **Naive Bayes Classifier** using `scikit-learn`'s `GaussianNB`. It's great for classification tasks, especially when features are continuous and normally distributed.

## ðŸ§  What is Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is a **probabilistic classification algorithm** based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with an assumption of independence between features.

### Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

It calculates the probability of each class and picks the most likely one for a given input.

## ðŸ§ª Quick Example

```python
from naive_bayes import NaiveBayesModel
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train
model = NaiveBayesModel()
model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
```
